## Few rules of expression blocks

- Always uses `{{ ... }}` (Bracket) tags.
- It always single-line blocks.

Expression blocks allow you to output a flag directly to the template directly (except for boolean) or indirectly by applying logical operations, filters and ternary operators.

```ft title="cheetsheet.txt.ft"
{# Expand some flag value #}
{{ some_flag }}

{# Expand value with some operators #}
{{ some_flag + 10 }}

{# Expand value with filter #}
{{ some_flag -> camel }}

{# Empty space !! #}
{{ boolean_flag }}

{# But you can use ternary operators #}
{{ boolean_flag do "true" else "false" }}
```

```ft title="stop.html.ft"
<main>
  <h1>STOP EATING {{ berry_flag -> upper }}!!!</h1>
</main>
```
